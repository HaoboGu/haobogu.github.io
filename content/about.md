I am Haobo Gu, a researcher and engineer on LLMs and code intelligence. As a core contributor, I developed [Tongyi Lingma](https://tongyi.aliyun.com/lingma), a series of code LLMs and also an AI powered code assistant, when I was at Alibaba DAMO Academy. I got my MS degree at University of Washington and bachelor degree at Tsinghua University. I'm now working on my personal project which aims to bring people new experience of interacting with machines by combining AI and hardwares. If you are interested in my work, please feel free to [contact me](mailto:haobogu@outlook.com).
